## About

Blog is an app that I've built in order to practice & learn RTK Query. In blog app, users can generate, update and delete authors.
Also users can create, edit and delete posts.
So it can be said that it is an app where users can perform CRUD operations.
I also practiced my backend skills with building a REST API using Node, Express and MongoDB.
